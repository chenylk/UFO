# UFO
## Overview
  * The purpose of this analysis was to provide a user with the ability to filter through UFO sighting data. This UFO sighting data was taken from a database and stored in list/dictionary format. 
  
## Results
  * The filters included in the data search are date, city, state, country, and shape. Once the user input is added, 'enter' is pressed to generate a new list on the ufo sightings chart with only the sightings that match the user input. The user can also combine multiple filters to narrow down the search to a specific location or date.

## Summary
  * A drawback for this search design is that there are less fields to search for than the amount of fields in the data. For example, the duration of the sighting cannot be searched for. This could be important for cetain users because they are particularly interested in longer sightings. A recommendation for this page would be to consider a 'between' filter for the date. If someone wanted to search for a sighting within a time period they could see all the sighting in the given date range. A second recommendation would be allowing the possibility to enter 2 values for the same field. For example, if someone wanted to see all of the UFO sightings in 2 seperate cities, they would be able to do so.
